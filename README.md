# CSFML_frag_shader_example
A CSFML example for OpenGL fragment shaders on sprites

A mix from differents SFML tutorials translated in CSFML

Needed:
-SFML 2.5
-CSFML 2.5
-math.h

To use:
-make
-./shader

Don't worry if a warning saying "sfShader_setFloatParameter is deprecated" shows up,
it's within the CSFML library, it works just fine.
